# Security Baseline: Photo CRM

This document establishes the mandatory security standards and controls for the application, based on **OWASP ASVS 5.0 (Application Security Verification Standard) Level 2** and modern Next.js/TypeScript architecture.

---

## 1. Authentication & Session Management (ASVS V6, V7)

- **Authentication Engine:** Self-hosted Better-Auth with PostgreSQL/Drizzle adapter (`better-auth@1.7.7`).
- **Owner Bootstrap:** Protected by `SETUP_TOKEN` with entropy verification (≥ 32 random bytes / 64 hex characters), constant-time comparison (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`), PostgreSQL transactional advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(746869)`), permanently disabled with 404 once owner user exists.
- **Password Policy:** Minimum 12 characters, up to 1024 characters. Supports spaces and emoji. No composition rules. Checked offline against a bundled dictionary of 7,158 common/breached passwords (`src/server/auth/passwords/common-passwords.json`).
- **Password Hashing:** OWASP-compliant `argon2id` via `@node-rs/argon2`: `memoryCost=65536` (64 MB), `timeCost=3`, `parallelism=4`, key length 32 bytes.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  - **TOTP (RFC 6238):** 6-digit codes, 30-second step, SHA-1 HMAC, ±1 window tolerance. Secrets encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with keys strictly derived from `AUTH_SECRET`. Replay prevention via monotonic `last_used_step` tracking. QR codes rendered via local vector SVG with accessible manual secret alternative.
  - **WebAuthn / Passkeys:** FIDO2 passkeys for passwordless authentication using `@simplewebauthn/server` helpers and Web Crypto. Validates origin, RP ID, challenge, attestation/assertion signatures, and monotonic signature counter.
  - **Single-Use Recovery Codes:** 10 cryptographically random codes (`xxxx-xxxx`) displayed once, stored securely using scrypt with unique high-entropy salts.
  - **Step-up Re-authentication:** Sensitive operations (TOTP disable, recovery code regeneration, last passkey deletion) enforce master password confirmation within a 5-minute freshness window (`last_reauthenticated_at`).
  - **Studio Enforcement:** Studio-level mandatory MFA policy (`mfa_required`) with grace period postponement (`mfa_postponed_until` up to 7 days).
  - **Rate Limiting:** Dedicated MFA rate limits (5 failures / 15 min per account, 20 failures / 15 min per IP).
- **Session Lifecycle:** Rotated on sign-in and privilege change to prevent session fixation. Configurable idle timeout (default 7 days) and absolute timeout (30 days). Server-side invalidation (`revokeSession`) and global revocation (`signOutEverywhere` invalidates all user sessions).
- **Client Portal Access:** Expiring (≤ 15 min) single-use magic links, or scoped, revocable per-project tokens stored hashed with SHA-256.

## 2. Access Control & Authorization (ASVS V8)

- **Default Deny:** All endpoints, server actions, and route handlers require explicit authentication and authorization via `requireOwner()` or `requireAuth({ scopes })` unless explicitly designated in `PUBLIC_AUTH_ACTIONS` allowlist.
- **Programmatic API Keys:** Scoped API tokens formatted as `pcrm_live_<32_bytes_hex>`. Displayed once to user and persisted only as SHA-256 hashes in `api_keys` table. Granular scopes (`clients:read`, `clients:write`, `projects:read`, `projects:write`, `settings:read`, `settings:write`). Route guard validates active session (all scopes) or matching key scope.
- **Object-Level Scoping:** Bare IDs from client requests are never trusted. All database reads and writes must include ownership criteria:
  ```typescript
  // Example pattern in repository layer:
  await db
    .select()
    .from(clients)
    .where(and(eq(clients.id, clientId), eq(clients.studioId, studioId)));
  ```
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Testing:** Every resource must have automated negative integration tests verifying that unauthorized actors receive 404/denial.

---

## 3. Input Validation & Encoding (ASVS V1, V2)

- **Validation at Boundaries:** All input to server actions and route handlers must be parsed using `zod` schemas with `.strict()`. Free-text fields have strict maximum length constraints.
- **Mass Assignment Prevention:** Data objects for database insertion must be constructed explicitly from schema-validated fields; never pass spread request bodies directly into ORM mutations.
- **Sanitisation:** Any user-controlled rich text or markdown (contract templates, questionnaires) must be sanitised with DOMPurify on both input and render.
- **Anti-Automation & Rate Limiting:** All authentication and public entry endpoints are protected by DB-backed rate limiting surviving restarts (`rate_limits` table with sliding window). Throttles after 10 failed sign-in attempts per 15 min per account, and after 50 failures per 15 min per IP across accounts.

---

## 4. Cryptography & Secrets (ASVS V11)

- **Secrets at Rest:** Sensitive integration credentials (OAuth tokens, CalDAV passwords, TOTP secrets) must be encrypted using AES-256-GCM with keys managed through environment variables or secure key vaults.
- **Randomness:** Use `crypto.randomBytes` or `crypto.randomUUID`. Never use `Math.random` for security tokens, session identifiers, or database IDs.
- **Document Integrity:** All electronically signed contracts must store the SHA-256 hash of the sealed PDF and the signing evidence trail.

---

## 5. Security Headers & Network Security (ASVS V3, V12)

- **HTTP Headers:** Nonce-based Content Security Policy with `strict-dynamic` (`script-src 'self' 'nonce-...' 'strict-dynamic'`, no `unsafe-inline` scripts), HTTP Strict Transport Security (`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` in production), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
- **SSRF Protection:** Outbound HTTP requests to user-configured endpoints (CalDAV servers, webhooks) must be validated using an SSRF-safe client that rejects private, link-local, loopback, and cloud metadata IP ranges.

---

## 6. Logging & Error Handling (ASVS V16)

- **PII-Safe Structured Logging:** Pino-based JSON logger with automatic redaction paths for `email`, `name`, `phone`, `address`, `password`, `token`, `authorization`, `cookie`, `ip`.
- **Audit Logging:** Append-only `audit_events` table for security-relevant and privacy-relevant operations (authentication, role changes, exports, deletions, signature events).
- **Error Messages:** User-facing responses must provide generic, localised error descriptions with correlation IDs. Detailed stack traces must never be exposed to clients.

---

## 7. Software Supply Chain & Licence Policy (ASVS V15)

- **Package Pinning:** Exact versions in `package.json` with a committed `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Allowed Licences (AGPL-3.0 Compatible):**
  - MIT, ISC, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0
  - AGPL-3.0, GPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0, MPL-2.0 (file-level)
  - Unlicense, CC0-1.0
- **Prohibited Licences:** Proprietary, Commercial, SSPL, BUSL, Commons Clause, GPL-2.0-only (without "or later" exception).
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions workflow pins by full 40-character commit SHA with version comments. Regular dependency updates via Dependabot/Renovate with a ≥ 3-day cooldown for non-security updates.
