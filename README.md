## Highlights

- **Own your data:** One instance per studio. No third-party telemetry, trackers, or external CDNs by default.
- **Privacy by design:** Automated data subject export (Art. 15/20 GDPR), erasure (Art. 17), consent tracking, and declarative retention policies with legal hold support.
- **Calm, mobile-first design:** Built for use in the studio or on location between shoots (WCAG 2.2 AA compliant).
- **Bilingual from day one:** English and German (`en`, `de`) with locale-aware date, time, and currency handling.
- **Client portal:** Seamless proposals, contracts with simple electronic signatures (SES), questionnaires, proofing galleries, and video delivery.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, React Server Components, TypeScript strict)
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (type-safe migrations)
- **Authentication:** Better-Auth (argon2id password hashing, TOTP & WebAuthn / Passkeys)
- **Design System:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Internationalisation:** next-intl (bilingual English / German)
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit & integration with PostgreSQL test containers) + Playwright with axe-core (E2E & a11y)
- **Licence:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** 24.x LTS (`node --version`)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm 10.x (`corepack enable && pnpm --version`)
- **Container Runtime:** Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose version`)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

2. Configure environment:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local secrets
   ```

3. Start local development services (PostgreSQL, Mailpit, local object storage):

   ```bash
   pnpm services:up
   ```

4. Run database migrations and seed synthetic demo data:

   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:seed:demo
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Mailpit UI is available at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025).
